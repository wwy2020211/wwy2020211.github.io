## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

Hello!This is my code diary.With a relatively solid professional knowledge in mathematical physics and coding . I previously majored in Artificial Intelligence. Recently,my research turns to AI for science, semiconductor physics mechaism simulation&analysis. I learn relative knowledge by myself and try to simulate some simple mechanism(such as Feelectric polarization &Phase transition), I have strong aspiration to develop in research Physics with AI.Sometimes I will upload some simple example about engineering in my major field or something amateur.
