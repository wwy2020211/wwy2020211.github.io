## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

Hello!This is my code diary.With a relatively solid professional knowledge in mathematical physics and coding . I previously majored in Artificial Intelligence. Recently,my research turns to the AI for Science(semiconductor physics mechanism analysis). I learn relative knowledge by myself and try to realize some simple simulation(such as Feelectronic polarization and Phase transaction), I have strong aspiration to develop in this field.Sometimes I will upload some simple example about engineering in my major field or something amateur.
